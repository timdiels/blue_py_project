Python 3 utility library. Looks like a turtle, tastes like chicken.

Chicken Turtle Util provides various Python utility functions (API).

Chicken Turtle is pre-alpha. None of the interface is stable, meaning it may
change in the future.

Chicken Turtle has some optional dependencies. E.g. to use
`chicken_turtle.pyqt`, you will need to add PyQt to your project's
dependencies. For now, you'll have to let the `ImportError`s guide you to the
right dependencies to add to setup.py assuming your tests have full coverage.
