        Get change listeners.

        Each change listener is called immediately after a mutating operation
        that actually changed the set. E.g. redundant additions are ignored.

        Returns
        -------
        ~typing.List[~typing.Callable[[~typing.FrozenSet, ~typing.FrozenSet], None]]
            List of change listeners. Each change listener takes 2 arguments:
            the items that were added, and the items that were removed. Note:
            Items can be added and removed from a set in a single operation.
            When a listener raises, the change is rolled back without further
            notification.
