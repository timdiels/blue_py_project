def merge_by_overlap(sets):
    '''
    Of a list of sets, merge those that overlap, in place.

    The result isn't necessarily a subsequence of the original ``sets``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sets : ~typing.Sequence[~typing.Set[~typing.Any]]
        Sets of which to merge those that overlap. Empty sets are ignored.

    Notes
    -----
    Implementation is based on `this StackOverflow answer`_. It outperforms all
    other algorithms in the thread (visited at dec 2015) on python3.4 using a
    wide range of inputs.

    .. _this StackOverflow answer: http://stackoverflow.com/a/9453249/1031434

    Examples
    --------
    >>> merge_by_overlap([{1,2}, set(), {2,3}, {4,5,6}, {6,7}])
    [{1,2,3}, {4,5,6,7}]
